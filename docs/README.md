# Documentation

Allium strives to be the language for logic programming at scale. There's still
a lot of work to do, but Allium will enable programmers to build reliable
systems simply and reason about their code effectively.

This document will undergo rapid changes, but this is the authoritative source
for information about the Allium language. We aim to describe the syntax and
semantics of the language generally, while also including copious illustrative
examples. However, if you see ways to improve this documentation, please open
an issue or pull request!
