# Documentation

Allium strives to be the language for logic programming at scale. There's still
a lot of work to do, but Allium will enable programmers to build reliable
systems simply and reason about their code effectively.

This document will still undergo many changes, but this is the authoritative
source for information about the Allium language. We aim to describe the syntax
and semantics of the language generally, while also including copious
illustrative examples. However, if you see ways to improve this documentation,
please open an issue or pull request!
