# Allium Utility Executables

This directory contains a Windows build of FileCheck for use by the Windows CI
runner. FileCheck is available through the Homebrew LLVM package on MacOS, and
through the apt package on Linux. However, I have not yet identified a readily
available build for Windows. As a gross hack, we instead include a build of it
here.
